# DATA DOWNLOAD
To start this project, you need an addition data file.

First you should download data from:
https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KFui9zZKjRqzFkCJH5nenw
    
Then unzip it,create a data dir, and put it in data directory

## After you do all that , the following file should be found:
 
```python
'data/segmented_train_seg_by_word.txt' 
```

And that means you are good to go.``


There should be three ipython notebooks in the directory:

1. ``` text_classify_basic.ipynb ``` is the code for RNN (Last Week,Lession 1)
2. ``` seq2seq_basic.ipynb.ipynb ``` is the code for machine translation (Last Week,Lession 2)
3. ``` word2vec_basic.ipynb ``` is the code for word embedding (Last Week,Lession 3)

Just follow the code there and you will get things running.
If you encounter any problem about the code, you can either contact me directly or post an issue here.

Finally, thank you guys for playing with my code.
Farewell and good luck.
